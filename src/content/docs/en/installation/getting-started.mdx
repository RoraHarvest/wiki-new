Ultramarine Linux comes in a form of an ISO image, which can be used to make a bootable DVD, or be flashed onto a USB stick.

This guide will help you get the correct ISO image, create your boot image and install Ultramarine Linux on your computer.

## System requirements

- 4GB of RAM (8GB or more recommended)
- 64-bit processor (x86_64/amd64) or an AArch64 processor (ARM64)
- 10GB of free disk space (20GB or more recommended)
- Internet connection (for downloading the ISO image, updates, and additional drivers)
- A computer that supports booting from a USB drive or DVD (most computers made after 2007 should support this feature)
- A DVD or USB drive (for creating the bootable media)
- Basic-to-intermediate computer knowledge

### Additional requirements for specific hardware

- For computers with NVIDIA graphics cards, you are strongly recommended to install additional drivers after installation. This can be done by opening the "Software" app and searching for "NVIDIA". You can also install the drivers by running `sudo dnf install nvidia-driver` in the terminal.
- For computers with AMD or Intel graphics cards, Ultramarine Linux should support your graphics card out of the box, as part of the Linux kernel.
- Some computers with specific Broadcom or Realtek chipsets may require additional drivers to be installed. You may need to connect to the internet via Ethernet or USB tethering from your phone to install these drivers.
- For computers with a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), you can enable it in the BIOS settings. However driver and kernel support for TPM may not work as expected. We recommend you disable Secure boot before installing Ultramarine Linux, then experiment with enabling it after installation.


## Downloading

### Choosing your edition

Ultramarine Linux comes in 4 variants:

- The **Flagship Edition**, which is the default and most popular variant, powered by the Budgie desktop environment and is made to stay out of your way. This is probably the version you want to use, and its desktop layout is similar to Windows or Chrome OS.
- The **GNOME Edition**, with the GNOME desktop environment designed to be elegant and modern. This is the variant you want if you would like a simple, unique experience.
- The **Pantheon Edition**, featuring elementary OS' Pantheon Desktop, made to be familiar to users coming from macOS.
- The **KDE Edition**, featuring the KDE Plasma desktop environment, which is made to be highly customizable and powerful. However it is not recommended for beginners or users who expect a simple and stable experience.

#### Ultramarine OSTree

Ultramarine Linux also comes with an OSTree variant, which works similarly to Fedora Silverblue, CoreOS and other OSTree-based operating systems. This variant is made for users who want a stable, immutable system that is easy to recover from.

However, this variant is recommended for users who want a rock-stable system and are willing to sacrifice some flexibility and customizability.
Such as casual users, or users who will be mostly using containerized applications such as Flatpak or Docker.

#### Other variants

**Ultramarine Kanopy** is an upcoming variant of Ultramarine Linux, which is made for servers and cloud computing. It is currently in development and does not have a release date yet, but is assumed to be around Q4 2023 to Q2 2024.
It will be based on Ultramarine OSTree and is designed as a simple and easy-to-use server operating system, with a focus on containerized applications with a simple, easy-to-use web interface as a competitor to TrueNAS SCALE, OpenMediaVault and other similar operating systems.

Ultramarine Linux supports Intel and AMD (amd64/x86_64) and ARM computers. Ultramarine Linux also has experimental support for Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs, but is not recommended for daily use.

The ISO images are available for download from the [Ultramarine Linux website](https://ultramarine-linux.org).

### Checking the integrity of the ISO image (Recommended)

If you would like to make sure the ISO image is valid, Ultramarine ISO images all come with a `CHECKSUM` file that can be checked against the image itself.

You do not need to do this unless you want to be extra sure that the disc image is valid, as the bootable image can also do a self-check on boot.

The checksum file is a SHA256 checksum of the ISO image, you can use the following command to check the integrity of the ISO image (if you're using another Linux distribution)

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.iso # Generate the checksum for the ISO image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the checksum on Windows

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
# Open the CHECKSUM file with Nodepad and compare the checksum
```

## Creating the bootable media

### With Ultramarine Linux

You can use the Fedora Media Writer to create a bootable media from the ISO image.

### With other operating systems (Windows, macOS, other Linux distributions)

You can use [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable media from the ISO image.

### With Windows (alternative)

You can use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) to create the bootable image.

## Booting to Ultramarine Linux

After flashing the image to your USB drive, you can boot to Ultramarine Linux by plugging in the drive and restarting your computer.

Before your computer boots to your current OS, please refer to your computer's documentation on which key to press to select a custom boot option.

<Alert type='info'>

Most BIOS has a special key combination that can be used to select a boot device, or to enter the BIOS setup screen. This varies from brand to brand. These keys may be `Esc`, `F1`, `F2`, `F8`, `F11`, `F12`, or even `Del`. The BIOS will usually display a message on the screen briefly on startup. If you're not sure which key to press, look up the BIOS setup instructions on the internet or ask your computer manufacturer.

On Macs, press power, then hold down the `Alt` or `Option` key until the Apple Logo appears.

## Footnotes

- Currently, the NVIDIA drivers are provided from RPM Fusion, but there are plans to re-package these drivers from negativo17's versions for a better general experience with CUDA and other NVIDIA software in the future.
- The Anaconda installer is very complex and hard to work with, we are working on a new installer that is easier to use and more reliable.
- Since Fedora 37, Fedora's official support for the Pantheon desktop environment has been dropped due to compatibility issues and the Pantheon port is now maintained by the Ultramarine Linux team. This means that the Pantheon desktop environment is only available through Ultramarine Linux, or Fedora with Terra enabled.
- Ultramarine's Budgie edition provides a close to stock Budgie experience, with a custom theme. Unlike Fedora's Budgie Spin, which provides a completely custom layout and experience.
