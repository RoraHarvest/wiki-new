After installing Ultramarine Linux, There are a few things you should do to make the most out of your new system.

## Install NVIDIA Drivers

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can install the latest drivers for it by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo dnf update # Update the system first, because NVIDIA drivers will build using the latest kernel.
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia # Install the NVIDIA kernel module.
```
Then, reboot your system.

<Alert type="warning">
  
You MUST wait until the akmods process is finished before rebooting. Rebooting too early might result in an improper installation!

sudo sed -i '10i\        Option "PrimaryGPU" "yes"' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf # Add PrimaryGPU = yes to the 10th line of the file.
```
